# CS210-Project-My-Valorant-Analysis

Summary:
Valorant is a team based (5v5) first-person tactical hero shooter game whoever wins the 13 rounds first, also wins the game. Each player chooses and agent before the game starts, and each agent has its’ own special abilities. In my project, I’ll be focusing on whether my received damage rate is higher than my dealt damage as the in-game playtime increases. With that I’ll be able to find whether I was a burden to team or was a player who carried the team. For more detail, please check the project report(CS210_ProjectReport_30788.pdf).
